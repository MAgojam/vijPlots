            <p><strong>Multiple Response Frequencies Help</strong></p>

            <p>This module computes frequencies for multiple response questions, also known as "Check All That Apply" (CATA) questions.</p>

            <p>Questions may be coded as :
            <ul>
                <li>several <strong>dummy (or indicator) variables</strong> using 1/0 or Y/N for each possible answer</li>
                <li>a single <strong>multi-valued variable</strong> containing the checked answers, separated by a symbol (usually "," or ";").</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>A sample file is included at Open > Data Library > vijPlots > Credit Cards</p>
